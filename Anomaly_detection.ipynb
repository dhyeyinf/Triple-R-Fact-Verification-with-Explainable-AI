In the case mentioned, Abbott, in his role as a justice, determined that the manufacturer of the vacuum cleaners had no duty or responsibility in the hiring process, as there was an existing agreement that explicitly assigned the responsibility to the distributors. However, it's important to note that Abbott's position was not the majority opinion, and there were differing views within the court. The court ultimately ruled that the manufacturer did have a role to play in the hiring process due to the specific circumstances of the case.
