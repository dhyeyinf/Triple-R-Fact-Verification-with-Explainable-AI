","Scrima did not specify how he would handle the half of the salary that he would decline. But voters were clearly left with the impression that his pledge would reduce the cost to taxpayers. ","The new mayor said he\u2019d work for half pay.

He has more say over how it is spent than if it went back to the city to hold down taxes. Creating the fund may be noble -- and clever, after all it is named after his campaign slogan.

The report does not provide updated yearly breakdowns for the period 2011 to 2019, but CBO's analysis at the time the bill was passed showed that the measure would increase the deficit in each year between 2009 and 2015, before reducing the deficit starting in 2016.

That's a lot of money per astronaut -- but there are two caveats worth mentioning. First, NASA has had a contract to pay the Russians to send someone to the International Space Station for more than a decade. And second, the overall space operations part of NASA's budget is dramatically declining so while $50 million or $63 million sounds outrageous -- it's something of a bargain.

The first U.S. astronaut to fly to the International Space Station on a Soyuz was Bill Shepherd on Oct. 31, 2000.

The space operations budget is broken into three categories: the space shuttle, International Space Station and Space and Flight support. The space shuttle line item is expected to dwindle during the next few years -- from $664.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to less than $1 million in 2016. NASA will pay for the contract with the Russians out of the line item for the International Space Station -- and that part of the budget is expected to rise from about $2.8 billion in 2012 to $3.2 billion in 2016.

We rated the statement Mostly False. He also said that four Florida high schools are in the Top 10 of the entire United States. We found that was true for one ranking but not others, so we rated his statement Half True. Scott also said that he cut taxes 24 times. Most of those cuts went to business owners, and he double-counted several measures, so we rated the statement Half True. Finally, Scott continues to claim that state government\u2019s taxing and borrowing crippled the Florida economy.

And as state treasurer, it was Giannoulias' job to oversee the Bright Start program. It's less clear, though, that it's accurate to claim Giannoulias lost that money. Yes, the Tribune story suggests Giannoulias had concerns early on about the aggressive investment strategy in the fund -- but that he opted to stick with the firm's strategy on the advice of Oppenheimer managers and an outside consultant. But analysts also credited Illinois with reacting more quickly to the issues than other states, and Giannoulias helped get a settlement with Oppenheimer to recoup half the losses.

Having done that, we rate the ad's claim Half True.","Together with the state attorney general, Giannoulias' office helped get a $77 million settlement from Oppenheimer -- recovering about half the estimated $150 million in losses suffered by the fund. And in December 2008, Giannoulias' office directed all new contributions to the fund to U.S. Treasury bonds. By then, the Tribune story notes, \"Core Plus had lost 38 percent of its value for the year. Over the same period, other funds of its type showed about a 5 percent return.\" ","When he was running to be Illinois state treasurer, Giannoulias promised to revitalize the state's 529 college savings plan, called Bright Start. But a year after taking office in 2007, one of the funds in the program -- one that was supposed to be relatively conservative -- took a nosedive, losing more than 35 percent of its value. The bond market took a beating in 2008 with the collapse of the housing market. Lots of people lost a lot of money on investments. But the fund in question did much worse than its peers. That the fund lost big is undisputed, but what's murkier is whether it's fair to tag Giannoulias with responsibility for some, all, or any, of those losses.

In 2001, McCain antagonized conservatives when he voted against President Bush\u2019s tax cuts, saying they needed to be paired up with equivalent cuts in spending. He voted against the 2003 round of cuts, too. ","The Obama campaign says the 94-vote figure is dishonest and misleading, and with a wink compiled its own list of McCain votes, using his camp\u2019s methodology. The results: the Republican candidate voted for higher taxes 477 times since arriving in Congress in 1982, including 105 occasions since 2005. Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden invoked the 477 figure during the vice presidential debate when Gov. Sarah Palin made the very same 94-vote charge. Biden said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bogus standard.\u201d ","However, McCain and the RNC both fail to note that some of the other votes would not have resulted in a net tax increase, but instead redistributed the burden among different payers. The 94-vote tally, for example, cites Obama\u2019s support of higher taxes on the oil and gas industries. But some of those Democratic tax plans that would have eliminated a tax break for domestic production or imposed a \u201cwindfall profits\u201d tax on the biggest oil companies would have applied the proceeds to wind energy, cellulosic ethanol, geothermal power and other emerging energy sources that produce less pollution than traditional sources. They also would have created a new incentive for consumers to buy plug-in hybrid cars and extend tax breaks for energy-efficient homes and businesses. ","We didn't track down all 477 votes the Democrats claimed, but we looked at a few and found that McCain, indeed, could be depicted as having voted to raise multiple taxes, just as Obama did, if one reads the fine print. For example, in May 2006, McCain voted for a massive fiscal 2006 tax and spending bill that, among other things, increased excise taxes on public charities and expanded the base of the tax on private foundation investment income. These revenue-raisers helped offset $70-billion in tax cuts, including reduced rates on capital gains and dividends and writeoffs for small businesses, according to a summary prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1997, McCain voted for a $100.4-billion, five-year tax cut package that, among other things, raised cigarette taxes 10 cents per pack in 2000 and 15 cents per pack in 2002. ","Ninety-four times?

The claims in the CDFE letter also assume that consumers will have no options come January when the new efficiency standards kick in. Even if you consider only the up-front cost of light bulbs, consumers would not be obligated to buy LED bulbs that cost as much as $50 apiece; nor would they be forced to purchase fluorescent alternatives that go for $3 apiece. There also are halogen incandescent bulbs for $1.49. It's true that all of these options will cost more at the store than traditional incandescent bulbs cost today. But when you factor in the cost of electricity needed to power the light bulb, they will end up costing significantly less. We rate the claim Barely True.","The curly-shaped compact fluorescent light bulbs use about 75 percent less electricity than comparable incandescent bulbs and last about 10 times longer, according to an analysis by the Department of Energy. As a result, the DOE concluded, \"typical CFLs can pay for themselves in less than nine months and then start saving you money each month.\" ","We spoke to Randy Moorhead, vice president of government affairs at Philips, which began selling its latest halogen incandescent bulbs at Home Depot in April. Moorhead said the EcoVantage light bulb -- which puts off as much light as a traditional 100 watt bulb -- comes with a suggested retail price of $1.49. That's roughly triple the cost of the existing 100 watt bulbs. However, it saves about $3.36 is reduced energy costs to the customer over the 1,000-hour life of the bulb, he said. In other words, the bulb may cost $1 more up front, but saves $3.36 in energy costs -- for a net savings of $2.35. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs even more up-front but saves more over the life of the bulb.

We wondered if it was possible that a war funding bill would have more money for the IMF than the wars. ","So as for Westmoreland's claim, he's wrong that the appropriations bill spends more money on the IMF than for the war. Lawmakers aren't literally giving the organization a bundle of cash. But he's right that there's a potential for the U.S. Treasury, over time, to give the IMF quite a chunk of change as a result of the line of credit. However, Westmoreland's claim is based on the premise that countries borrowing from the IMF will never pay those loans back, which is a worst-case scenario that experts say is unlikely to occur. So we rate his claim Barely True. ","Overall, the bill costs about $106 billion, according to the House Appropriations Committee. Approximately $82 billion \u2014 or about 77 percent \u2014 is for war-related items, everything from new machinery to hospitals.

They've been courted by both supporters and opponents of the Democratic reform plan. President Barack Obama held a Rose Garden ceremony with some of them recently. And now opponents of the Democratic health care plan are citing poll results that supposedly show that lots of doctors would be so unhappy with the reforms that they'd quit their jobs. ","In addition, the specific question asked of respondents was, \"If Congress passes their health care plan, will you ... continue your practice, or consider leaving your practice or taking an early retirement?\" This wording leaves open the possibility that respondents are saying they might simply leave their current practice to join another practice, rather than quit. ","So, back to Beck's statement. First, he misstated the results of the poll. The survey didn't say 45 percent would quit; it said they would consider quitting, which is considerably different. Moreover, polling experts have raised significant questions about the poll's methodology. Of special concern are the combination of the heavy mention of IBD 's name and questions that experts said appeared to be seeking answers critical of health reform. We'd like to see an independent poll assessing doctors' views of health care reform, but neither the findings from the IBD survey nor those from the Keyhani-Federman study are fully persuasive to us. We rate Beck's statement False.","\u2022 Beck misstated what the poll asked . Beck said that 45 percent of doctors will quit. But in fact, the poll found that 45 percent of doctors said they will consider quitting. Considering quitting isn't the same thing as quitting, which makes Beck's statement a significant exaggeration. ","In the IBD poll, 65 percent of the doctors who responded said they opposed \"government's proposed health care plan\" while just 33 percent supported it. By contrast, the Keyhani-Federman poll found that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, as congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama have advocated. Another 10 percent said they favored a single-payer health care system \u2014 a solution that is actually to the left of the president.

While both sides agree that consumers will end up paying more \u2014 Obama himself once said \" electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket \" \u2014 the actual amount is a matter of dispute. ","The cap-and-trade bill currently making its way through Congress was written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. ","* Of all the estimates we could find, the one from the Environmental Protection Agency had the lowest cost. (It's important to point out that the EPA is part of the Obama administration, which supports a cap-and-trade plan.) It says cap-and-trade will only cost consumers an average of $80-$111 a year \u2014 or about 22 to 30 cents a day \u2014 so long as most program revenue is returned to consumers. The EPA looked at higher energy prices, price changes for other goods and services, and impacts on wages through 2050. The EPA predicts that cost will fluctuate over the next 40 years as the cost of allowances generally goes up. For example, in 2020, the EPA estimates that allowances will cost about $16 per ton of carbon emissions and that means consumers will be paying upward of $61 a year. But in 2050, when allowances will no longer be free, consumers could pay anywhere from $123 to $174. ","* The conservative Heritage Foundation predicts a much higher price tag: By 2035, cap-and-trade will increase the average family's annual energy bill by $1,241. The number is higher because the study assumes that traditional energy sources will be scaled back to meet new emissions standards, but will not be immediately replaced by new technology or renewable fuels. As a result, energy prices will go up and continue to rise, the Heritage report predicts. Both the CBO and EPA estimates assume that, at some point, cleaner technologies and renewable energy will replace fossil fuel, which will translate to lower costs to consumers. (The Heritage Foundation provides no information on its Web site as to when its model assumes this phase-in will occur, if at all.) To be fair, the EPA predits that renewable fuel production will actually be less than without a cap-and-trade plan in place; energy efficiency improvements will be the primary reason for lower emissions. ","At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits \u2014 also known as allowances \u2014 to continue polluting.
